# Python ETL Pipeline with Data Validation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple but realistic Python-based ETL
(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline commonly used in analytics and
data engineering workflows.

The focus is on clean Python structure, data validation, and handling
real-world data issues rather than complex frameworks.

## Objectives
- Extract data from flat files
- Apply transformations using Python
- Validate data before loading
- Log pipeline steps and failures
- Demonstrate interview-ready ETL scenarios

## ETL Design
The pipeline is structured into clear stages:
- Extract: Read raw input data
- Transform: Clean and standardize data
- Load: Write validated data to an output destination

## Status
Project initialized. ETL components will be added incrementally.
